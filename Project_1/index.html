            A successful HTML page example provides inspiration as you craft your own site and an example of what a successful site looks like in practice. That’s why it’s worthwhile to take a look.

                <h2>Understanding the Basics of HTML Websites</h2>
                <br>
                <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the primary language of the World Wide Web. An HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page. When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.<br><br>

                    HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: CSS and JavaScript. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that controls the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex client-side features like interactive elements and animations.<br><br>
                    
                    The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5. Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements to handle multimedia content like audio and video and semantically rich elements to describe page structure.<br><br>
                    
                    Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML. That means there will be no HTML6, and HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a number of improvements and enhancements have been released since HTML5 came out in 2008. <br><br>
                    
                    If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting with our ultimate guide to HTML. You’ll learn everything you need to know to understand this post in its entirety.<br><br>
                    
                    Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of technologies involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it. And yes, this is true even if the website uses server-side languages like PHP (such as WordPress). With a tool like WordPress, the web server will process the PHP and query the site's database to generate the finished HTML document to deliver to visitors' browsers.<br><br>
                    
                    You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that bring it to life. <br><br>
                    
                    Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways designers and developers harness HTML in their creative works.</p>

           <h2>A Few Ideas for HTML Websites</h2> 
           <p>
            To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good idea for you to create a website or two from scratch. <br><br>

            Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML works and provide you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects. <br><br>

            Here are some ideas for beginner-friendly simple HTML projects you can create:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A personal website.</strong> Create a personal site that shows off your resume, work experience, interests, skills, and personality. You can return to this project and revise over time as your skills develop.  </li> <br><br>
                <li><strong>An informational site.</strong> Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple website that teaches visitors about it. You can play around with various technologies to enhance your storytelling — we'll share some examples below.</li><br><br>
                <li><strong>A small business website or a non-profit website.</strong> You can volunteer to create a website for a small local business in your area. Or, you can help a non-profit and give it an online presence.</li><br><br>
                <li><strong>A blog.s</strong> While there are many great blogging platforms out there, consider making your own. A simple HTML website can work great for basic blogs.</li><br><br>
                <li> <Strong>A portfolio.</Strong> Want to show off your other creative works? Try building a portfolio, be it a photo gallery, a video showcase, or a collection of your writing. The best part? We even have a step-by-step guide for beginners on how to create a portfolio site with HTML. </li><br><br>
            </ul>
            <br>
            To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this excellent tutorial from freeCodeCamp. <br><br>
            <p>
                <iframe width="600" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PlxWf493en4" title="HTML Tutorial - How to Make a Super Simple Website" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </p>
            As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out into bolder, more unique design choices. But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features working together to make a cohesive experience. <br><br>

            Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements creatively. I’ll also help unpack what makes them tick.

                <h2>How to Make Your Own Simple HTML Website</h2>
                <div>
                    If you've made it this far, you might be wondering how you can create your own HTML website, like some of the examples above. <br><br>

                    While many of the more advanced HTML page example options require a more in-depth mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you still have options to build an engaging website, even if you're just getting started with learning these technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are two routes that you can use to make your first HTML site: <br><br>
                    <h3>Static HTML Website Generator</h3>
                    If you don‘t want to write all of your site’s HTML code from scratch, there are lots of static HTML website generator tools that you can use to create a basic HMTL site. <br><br>

                    If you still don't feel totally comfortable working with code, I think that the easiest option for most people is to use WordPress and a static site generator plugin like Simply Static. <br><br>

                    You can build your website with WordPress, including using WordPress themes to control the design of your site. You'll also still be able to use a lot of WordPress plugins (though some plugins won't work as a static HTML site). Then, you can export your finished website as a static HTML site using the Simply Static plugin.<br><br>

                    All you need to do is upload those HTML files to a static web host like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify, and you will have a simple HTML website that people can access from anywhere in the world.<br><br>

                    If you don't want to use WordPress, there are also lots of other static HTML site generator tools with varying levels of complexity — here are some of my favorites: <br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Webflow (like WordPress, it gives you an option to export your site as a static HTML site)</li><br><br>
                    <li>Jekyll</li><br><br>
                    <li>Hugo</li><br><br>
                    <li>Gridsome</li><br><br>
                    <li>Eleventy</li><br><br>
                    <li>Pelican</li><br><br>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Code From Scratch (or Use a Simple HTML Website Template)</h3><br>
                    If you feel comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your entire site, you can also code your website from scratch. <br><br>

                    Building a simple HTML website using HTML and CSS is also a great way to teach yourself these fundamental web development languages, as I mentioned earlier. <br><br>

                    You can use HTML code editors like Sublime Text or Atom to build your website on your local computer. Then, you just need to upload your site's static files to your favorite static website hosting service to make it live. <br><br>

                    To help you save time, you can use a simple HTML website template or library. For example, I think the popular Bootstrap library makes it a lot easier to build a great-looking website, as it offers tons of pre-built components. This can save you from having to write every single line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. <br><br>

                    I recommend checking out our guide to Bootstrap if you're interested. We also have posts on Bootstrap Buttons, building Bootstrap web forms, and overriding Bootstrap CSS when needed. <br><br>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="5">
                <h2>HTML Page Example </h2>
                <br>
                <p>Creating an HTML site doesn't have to be complex — and by taking a look at some HTML page examples, you can see that for yourself. <br><br>

                    Here's an HTML page example I love that demonstrates getting started isn't as tricky as you think it will be. <br><br>
                <div>
                    <iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/hubspot/embed/xxeENvp?height=300&default-tab=html%2Cresult&slug-hash=xxeENvp&user=hubspot&name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_xxeENvp"></iframe>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                On Codepen, I created an example of how you can get started building an HTML page. As you can see, it's rather intuitive. <br><br>

                <h2>Craft Your Perfect Website with HTML</h2> 
                We spend so much time on websites that we may not realize what goes on behind the scenes. But, if you understand the frameworks for your favorite websites, this gives you invaluable insight into how the best online experiences are made. With that knowledge, you can build your own online experiences that engage, captivate, and delight your new audience. <br><br>
